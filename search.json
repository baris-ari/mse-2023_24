    "text": "1.5 Create a Simple Dataset\nImagine that we have the names and birth years of a number of people. We cannot really hold each piece of information in a separate object. We would like to store them altogether in a single object, like a spreadsheet.\nLet’s start with names. We have five people:\n\nRishi Sunak\nLiz Truss\nBoris Johnson\nTheresa May\nDavid Cameron\n\nWe can store their full names in a single object using the combine function c.\n\nnames_pm <- c(\"Rishi Sunak\",\n              \"Liz Truss\",\n              \"Boris Johnson\",\n              \"Theresa May\",\n              \"David Cameron\",\n              \"Gordon Brown\",\n              \"Tony Blair\")\n\nNote that each PMs name is written within quotation and they are combined together with the function c(). Each item within c() is separated with a comma. Let’s see the object:\n\nnames_pm\n#> [1] \"Rishi Sunak\"   \"Liz Truss\"     \"Boris Johnson\" \"Theresa May\"  \n#> [5] \"David Cameron\" \"Gordon Brown\"  \"Tony Blair\"\n\nGreat! We have the names of the last five UK PMs.\nYou may have realized that there are numbers in squared brackets in the beginning of each line.\nThese numbers refer to the order in the sequence. For example, “Rishi Sunak” is the first item whereas “David Cameron” is the fifth.\nYou can recall a particular item in the object using square brackets. Let’s print the first item in names_pm.\n\nnames_pm[1]\n#> [1] \"Rishi Sunak\"\n\nSimilarly, for the third item, you would use [3]:\n\nnames_pm[3]\n#> [1] \"Boris Johnson\"\n\nFind the fifth name in the object.\n\n\nReveal the code\n\nnames_pm[5]\n#> [1] \"David Cameron\"\n\n\nYou can add more than one number into the square brackets using the c() function. For example, who are the second and fourth names?\n\nnames_pm[c(2,4)]\n#> [1] \"Liz Truss\"   \"Theresa May\"\n\nNext, let’s write down their birth year. The order is important! You need to keep the same order with PMs.\n\nbirth_years <- c(1980, # Rishi Sunak\n                 1975, # Liz Truss\n                 1964, # Boris Johnson\n                 1956, # Theresa May\n                 1966, # David Cameron\n                 1951, # Gordon Brown\n                 1953  # Tony Blair)\n                 )\n\nCheck the object we just created.\n\nbirth_years\n#> [1] 1980 1975 1964 1956 1966 1951 1953\n\nLet’s put them together in a spreadsheet. What we would like to do is to vertically bind the two objects, which is called column bind and denoted with cbind.\n\ncbind(names_pm, birth_years)\n#>      names_pm        birth_years\n#> [1,] \"Rishi Sunak\"   \"1980\"     \n#> [2,] \"Liz Truss\"     \"1975\"     \n#> [3,] \"Boris Johnson\" \"1964\"     \n#> [4,] \"Theresa May\"   \"1956\"     \n#> [5,] \"David Cameron\" \"1966\"     \n#> [6,] \"Gordon Brown\"  \"1951\"     \n#> [7,] \"Tony Blair\"    \"1953\"\n\nPut this into an object.\n\nmy_data <- cbind(names_pm, birth_years)\n\nmy_data\n#>      names_pm        birth_years\n#> [1,] \"Rishi Sunak\"   \"1980\"     \n#> [2,] \"Liz Truss\"     \"1975\"     \n#> [3,] \"Boris Johnson\" \"1964\"     \n#> [4,] \"Theresa May\"   \"1956\"     \n#> [5,] \"David Cameron\" \"1966\"     \n#> [6,] \"Gordon Brown\"  \"1951\"     \n#> [7,] \"Tony Blair\"    \"1953\"\n\nNote that birth_years are stored as text, not numbers. I know this because they are within quotation marks.\nIt is customary to keep spreadsheets as something called “data frames” in R. This will not change our data, but makes further operations easier by unlocking some of the features of R.\n\nmy_data <- as.data.frame(my_data)\n\nmy_data\n#>        names_pm birth_years\n#> 1   Rishi Sunak        1980\n#> 2     Liz Truss        1975\n#> 3 Boris Johnson        1964\n#> 4   Theresa May        1956\n#> 5 David Cameron        1966\n#> 6  Gordon Brown        1951\n#> 7    Tony Blair        1953\n\nWe can take a better look at the dataset using View() function.\n\n\nView(my_data)\n\nColumns in a data frame are also called variables. We have two variables in the dataset:\n\nnames_pm : Name of the UK PM\nbirth_years: Birth year of the PM\n\nThere are a few ways to access a variable. A straightforward approach is to use the $ notation:\n\n# 'name of the data frame'$'name of the variable' \nmy_data$names_pm\n#> [1] \"Rishi Sunak\"   \"Liz Truss\"     \"Boris Johnson\" \"Theresa May\"  \n#> [5] \"David Cameron\" \"Gordon Brown\"  \"Tony Blair\"\n\nNow it is your turn. Display the names variable.\n\n\nReveal the code\nmy_data$birth_years\n#> [1] \"1980\" \"1975\" \"1964\" \"1956\" \"1966\" \"1951\" \"1953\"\n\n\nYou can think this expression as a sentence in R. In plain English, this expression tells R to bring the variable names_pm within the data frame my_data. The symbol $ refers to the ‘within’ part of this sentence.\nJust like you can convey the same meaning using different sentence structures, there are different ways to do the same thing in R. This is because R is working exactly like a language: it is a language to communicate with the computer.\nAnother way is using the square brackets notation []. names_pm is the first column in the data frame. To get the variable, you could type the following.\n\nmy_data[,1]\n#> [1] \"Rishi Sunak\"   \"Liz Truss\"     \"Boris Johnson\" \"Theresa May\"  \n#> [5] \"David Cameron\" \"Gordon Brown\"  \"Tony Blair\"\n\nNote that we did not simply write my_data[1]. There is a comma: my_data[,1]\nIn a spreadsheet, we have two dimensions: rows and columns. By convention, rows are considered as the first dimension, and columns are considered as the second. This is why we had to use a comma to designate that we are interested in columns. If left the first dimension unspecified, which tells R to bring everything.\nIf you want to get the first row, you would type the following.\n\nmy_data[1,]\n#>      names_pm birth_years\n#> 1 Rishi Sunak        1980\n\nTry it yourself; get the fourth row.\n\n\nReveal the code\nmy_data[4,]\n#>      names_pm birth_years\n#> 4 Theresa May        1956\n\n\nLet’s put these together: you can tell R to bring a specific observation. For example, third row of second column.\n\nmy_data[3,2]\n#> [1] \"1964\"\n\nYou can also ask for multiple items by plugging in the combine function.\n\n# Third and fourth row of second column\nmy_data[c(3,4), 2]\n#> [1] \"1964\" \"1956\""

There are different spreadsheet file types (such as Excels .xlsx), but the most common and compatible one is .csv, which stands for comma separated values. This is basically plain text that any computer and most electronic devices can open.\n\nwrite.csv(x = my_data, file = \"my_first_file.csv\", row.names = F)\n\nThis should create a file somewhere in your computer, more precisely, in your working directory.

R Studio has nice tools for navigation.\nYou can directly go to your working directory through Files tab (usually in right bottom corner) and More drop-down menu. Under there there are a few options: - Set as working directory: sets your working directory as the current directory shown in Files - Go to working directory: takes you to current working directory\nIf you click on go to working directory, you should see my_first_file.csv here.\nIt is a good idea to create a new directory (folder for Windows) for this module. Your folder names should be simple and easy to write. For example: mse_23-24 is a good name. Try not to use space in file names. Underscore and dash are better alternatives. Also, I encourage always using lowercase for file names, which also goes for object names in R.\nYou can use your operating system to create this directory. You could also use R Studio’s Files tab. Put this folder somewhere easy to access.\nLet’s save your R script. You can use drop-down menu: File >> Save or simply, cmd/control+s is the keyboard shortcut.\nGive an intuitive name to your script. For example, 01_RBasics.R is a good name.\nIt is generally good idea to keep your data in a sub-directory named data. Create such a directory and move my_first_file.csv there.\nNext week, we will continue with a simple dataset, which will be available on Blackboard."

    "text": "3.2 Summary of a Categorical Variable\nLet’s describe a categorical variable. We can work with Geographical_Region, which records where a country is located geographically. To see how many countries are in each region, we can use table() and provide a descriptive summary of this variable.\n\ntable(df$Geographical_Region)\n#> \n#>                   Africa                 Americas                     Asia \n#>                       47                       27                       30 \n#>                   Europe Mid. East & North Africa                   Ocenia \n#>                       39                       17                        6\n\nNow, we have a frequency table of Geographical_Region. I can see that 47 countriese are in Africa, 27 in Americas and so on. For categorical variables, a frequency table is appropriate for a descriptive summary.\nWe can also create a bar plot and visually summarize the data. Each bar will represent the number of countries in each geographical region. In short, we will visually display the information in table(df$Geographical_Region) using a barplot.\n\nbarplot(height = table(df$Geographical_Region))\n\n\n\n\nThis is a good start, but we will do better. Before going any further, let’s unpack the code. The function barplot() takes a vector of numbers, which it uses to display heights. For instance, if we want to display four bars with heights 5, 10, 12 and 7, we can plug such a vector into barplot().\n\nbarplot(height = c(5,10,12,7))\n\n\n\n\nNote that bars above don’t have labels at the moment, because we did not provide any information. For Geographical_Region, however, table() creates a named vector.\n\n# A named vector:\ntable(df$Geographical_Region)\n#> \n#>                   Africa                 Americas                     Asia \n#>                       47                       27                       30 \n#>                   Europe Mid. East & North Africa                   Ocenia \n#>                       39                       17                        6\n\n# Names:\nnames(table(df$Geographical_Region))\n#> [1] \"Africa\"                   \"Americas\"                \n#> [3] \"Asia\"                     \"Europe\"                  \n#> [5] \"Mid. East & North Africa\" \"Ocenia\"\n\nGoing back to our hypothetical barplot, we can provide it a names argument. Let’s say the numbers 5, 10, 12 and 7 correspond to Orange, Banana, Apple, Pear.\n\nbarplot(height = c(5,10,12,7), names.arg = c(\"Orange\", \"Banana\", \"Apple\", \"Pear\"))\n\n\n\n\nSo the barplot() above took the height and names.arg arguments.\nFor easier read and navigation, it is a good idea to use a systematic way to write the code. You can press ↵ after the end of the first argument.\n\n# easier to read code\nbarplot(height = c(5,10,12,7), \n        names.arg = c(\"Orange\", \"Banana\", \"Apple\", \"Pear\")\n        )\n\n\n\n\nNow we have a very good idea how barplot() works. Going back to the bar plot for Geographical_Region, the category “Mid. East & North Africa” is too long. I want to change it with just “MENA”.\nYou can take assign table input to an object and work on it.\n\n# Get the table() into an object\nbarplot_input <- table(df$Geographical_Region)\n\n# Check the object\nbarplot_input\n#> \n#>                   Africa                 Americas                     Asia \n#>                       47                       27                       30 \n#>                   Europe Mid.

    "text": "3.4 Summary of a Numerical Variable\nNext, let’s work with a numerical variable. Life_exp_female is a measurement of female life expectancy across the world in 2010. The function summary() will give the min, max, mean, median, and first and third quartiles.\n\n# Summary of the variable\nsummary(df$Life_exp_female)\n#>    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.

We briefly visited quantile() for demonstration purposes. There are many ways to achieve the same thing in R.\nFor dispersion, variance and standard deviation can be calculated.\n\n# standard deviation\nsd(df$Life_exp_female)\n#> [1] 9.353926\n\n# variance\nvar(df$Life_exp_female)\n#> [1] 87.49594\n\n# recall that square root of variance is standard deviation\nsqrt( var(df$Life_exp_female) )\n#> [1] 9.353926\n\n# ask R if you don't believe me\nsd(df$Life_exp_female) == sqrt( var(df$Life_exp_female) )\n#> [1] TRUE"

    "section": "3.5 Visual Summary",
    "text": "3.5 Visual Summary\nWhen working on a new dataset, it is always a good idea to start by visually summarizing your variables one by one. This will help you to get a sense of the data.\nFor a numerical variable, two types of graphs are appropriate for a visual summary:\n\nHistogram\nBox plot\n\n\n3.5.1 Histogram\n\n# histogram:\nhist(df$Life_exp_female)\n\n\n\n\nYou can tell R how many bins you would like to have in your histogram by using the breaks argument, but as the R help file clarifies, this number is a suggestion only, and R can use a different (but similar value) to draw a pretty histogram.\n\n# histogram with fewer bins\nhist(df$Life_exp_female, breaks = 5)\n\n\n\n\n# histogram with higher number of bins\nhist(df$Life_exp_female, breaks = 30)\n\n\n\n\nYou might want to specify cut points. For example, you might want to have a sequence from 40 to 100 with increment of 5.\n\n# a sequence from 40 to 100 by 5\nseq(from = 40, to = 100, by = 5)\n#>  [1]  40  45  50  55  60  65  70  75  80  85  90  95 100\n\n# put it into an object\nmy_breaks <- seq(from = 40, to = 100, by = 5)\n\n# this will be our break points\n\n#tell R to do the histogram using these points\nhist(df$Life_exp_female, breaks = my_breaks)\n\n\n\n\nThis looks quite nice and intuitive. However, titles are not defined. I don’t want to see df$Life_exp_female as an axis or main graph title.\n\n#Histogram with titles and breaks\nhist(df$Life_exp_female, \n     breaks = my_breaks, \n     main = \"Female Life Expectancy in 2010\",\n     ylab = \"Number of Countries\",\n     xlab = \"Age\"\n     )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5.2 Boxplot\nAnother graphical summary for a numerical variable is box plot. They are really nice to get a sense of the data, understand the distribution, and quickly see if there are any outliers. They are also very good at creating visual comparisons across groups, something which we will cover in upcoming weeks.\n\n# Boxplot\nboxplot(df$Life_exp_female,\n        main = \"Female Life Expectancy in 2010\",\n        ylab = \"Age\")\n\n\n\n\nThis box plot helps us to visualize the five-point summary. You can see minimum, max, median and first and third quartiles.\nIf you don’t believe me, we can plot these over the boxplot.\n\n# box plot:\nboxplot(df$Life_exp_female,\n        main = \"Female Life Expectancy in 2010\",\n        ylab = \"Age\")\n\n# you can add a line to a plot by abline\n# h stands for horizontal\n# tell R to draw a horizontal line at the median of Life_exp_female\nabline(h = median(df$Life_exp_female))\n\n\n\n\nYou can draw lines for each statistic.\n\n# box plot:\nboxplot(df$Life_exp_female,\n        main = \"Female Life Expectancy in 2010\",\n        ylab = \"Age\")\n\n# median\nabline(h = median(df$Life_exp_female))\n\n# min\nabline(h = min(df$Life_exp_female))\n\n# max\nabline(h = max(df$Life_exp_female))\n\n# first quartile\nabline(h = quantile(df$Life_exp_female, probs = 0.25))\n\n# third quartile\nabline(h = quantile(df$Life_exp_female, probs = 0.75))\n\n\n\n\nWe drew these lines for demonstration purposes and show that a box plot visualizes the information in a five-point summary."

    "text": "3.6 Dealing with missingness\nSometimes our variable of interest may have missing values inside. For example, GDP per capita PPP (PPP stands for purchasing power parity) variable is GDP_pc_PPP. GDP data for some countries are missing.\n\nsummary(df$GDP_pc_PPP)\n#>     Min.  1st Qu.

Let’s find these five countries. The function is.na() tells whether something is missing or not.\n\n# is GDP_pc_PPP missing\nis.na(df$GDP_pc_PPP)\n#>   [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n#>  [13] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n#>  [25] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE\n#>  [37] FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n#>  [49] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n#>  [61] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n#>  [73] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n#>  [85] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n#>  [97] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n#> [109] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n#> [121]  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n#> [133] FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE\n#> [145] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n#> [157] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n\n# what is the name of the country with missing GDP_pc_PPP\ndf$Country_Name[is.na(df$GDP_pc_PPP) == TRUE]\n#> [1] \"Cuba\"       \"Djibouti\"   \"Korea, Dem\" \"Somalia\"    \"Syrian Ara\"\n\n# you can think the statement above as this:\n# Bring 'Country Name' such that 'GDP' is missing\n\nDealing with missingness appropriately is important because it might create problems. For example, regular functions mean() and max() will get confused if we do not deal with missingness explicitly.\n\n# mean of GDP_pc_PPP\nmean(df$GDP_pc_PPP)\n#> [1] NA\n\n# R tells me it is missing \n# because you cannot make a calculation with a missing value\n\n# Tell R that to remove missing values\nmean(df$GDP_pc_PPP, na.rm = TRUE) # na.rm stands for 'na remove'\n#> [1] 15494.4\n\nThis is also the case for other functions such as min() and max().\n\n# same for max and min\nmax(df$GDP_pc_PPP) # without na.rm\n#> [1] NA\nmax(df$GDP_pc_PPP, na.rm = FALSE) # na.rm FALSE\n#> [1] NA\nmax(df$GDP_pc_PPP, na.rm = TRUE) # na.rm TRUE \n#> [1] 122609.4\n\n# instead of TRUE or FALSE you ca write T and F\nmin(df$GDP_pc_PPP)\n#> [1] NA\nmin(df$GDP_pc_PPP, na.rm = T)\n#> [1] 646.86\nmin(df$GDP_pc_PPP, na.rm = F)\n#> [1] NA\n\nGraphical functions will handle missingness automatically.\n\n# histogram\nhist(df$GDP_pc_PPP)\n\n\n\n\n\n# boxplot\nboxplot(df$GDP_pc_PPP)\n\n\n\n\nThis final box plot above (for GDP per capita) shows six points above the vertical line denoting the maximum. What are those?\nThey are outliers. These countries have a very high values for GDP per capita. These values are quite different than the rest as they are much higher. Such values are called outliers.\nLet’s find which countries have these highest values. To do so, I am going to sort my data frame. order() will give me the row number based on ordering of a variable.\n\n# row numbers by highest GDP_pc_PPP\norder(df$GDP_pc_PPP, decreasing = T)\n\n# get these row numbers to a row\n# so that we don't need to write this long statement again and again\nrow_nos <- order(df$GDP_pc_PPP, decreasing = T)\n\n\n# First item in row_nos is the row number of the highest GDP_pc_PPP\nrow_nos[1]\n#> [1] 124\n\n# get the name of the country\ndf$Country_Name[ row_nos[1] ]\n#> [1] \"Qatar\"\n\n# recall that for the first six rows, you could write this\nrow_nos[c(1,2,3,4,5,6)]\n#> [1] 124  82 131 111  24 158\n\n# writing c(...) is cumbersome\nc(1,2,3,4,5,6) \n#> [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6\n\n# a better approach is \nseq(1,6)\n#> [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6\n\n# R has a shortcut for this:\n1:6 #(from 1 to 6)\n#> [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6\n\n# row numbers of the highest 6 observations (GDP_pc_PPP)\nrow_nos[1:6]\n#> [1] 124  82 131 111  24 158\n\n# plug this into df$Country_Name\ndf$Country_Name[ row_nos[1:6] ]\n#> [1] \"Qatar\"      \"Kuwait\"     \"Singapore\"  \"Norway\"     \"Switzerlan\"\n#> [6] \"United Sta\""
