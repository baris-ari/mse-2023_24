Each R object must be one-word only, so I use _ instead of space. We could also have used a dot or dash.\n\n# This is a comment. \n# Characters after a hashtag are considered as comments by R. \n# They are not executed.\n# Use comments extensively to take notes \n# and to remind your future self of the work you did. \n\n# \"<-\" is the assignment operator\n# It basically symbolizes an arrow.\n\nmy_birth_year <- 1985\n\nNow the Environment should store an object called my_birth_year. When I run my_birth_year, R will display the information stored.\n\nmy_birth_year\n#> [1] 1985\n\nNote that R is case sensitive. If you mistype, such as My_birth_year, it will give you an error message.\n\nMy_birth_year\n#> Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'My_birth_year' not found\n\nWe can find your age by subtracting current year from my_birth_year.\n\n2023 - my_birth_year\n#> [1] 38\n\nWe typed 2023 manually.

    "text": "1.5 Create a Simple Dataset\nImagine that we have the names and birth years of a number of people. We cannot really hold each piece of information in a separate object. We would like to store them altogether in a single object, like a spreadsheet.\nLet’s start with names. We have five people:\n\nRishi Sunak\nLiz Truss\nBoris Johnson\nTheresa May\nDavid Cameron\n\nWe can store their full names in a single object using the combine function c.\n\nnames_pm <- c(\"Rishi Sunak\",\n              \"Liz Truss\",\n              \"Boris Johnson\",\n              \"Theresa May\",\n              \"David Cameron\",\n              \"Gordon Brown\",\n              \"Tony Blair\")\n\nNote that each PMs name is written within quotation and they are combined together with the function c(). Each item within c() is separated with a comma. Let’s see the object:\n\nnames_pm\n#> [1] \"Rishi Sunak\"   \"Liz Truss\"     \"Boris Johnson\" \"Theresa May\"  \n#> [5] \"David Cameron\" \"Gordon Brown\"  \"Tony Blair\"\n\nGreat! We have the names of the last five UK PMs.\nYou may have realized that there are numbers in squared brackets in the beginning of each line.\nThese numbers refer to the order in the sequence. For example, “Rishi Sunak” is the first item whereas “David Cameron” is the fifth.\nYou can recall a particular item in the object using square brackets. Let’s print the first item in names_pm.\n\nnames_pm[1]\n#> [1] \"Rishi Sunak\"\n\nSimilarly, for the third item, you would use [3]:\n\nnames_pm[3]\n#> [1] \"Boris Johnson\"\n\nFind the fifth name in the object.\n\n\nReveal the code\n\nnames_pm[5]\n#> [1] \"David Cameron\"\n\n\nYou can add more than one number into the square brackets using the c() function. For example, who are the second and fourth names?\n\nnames_pm[c(2,4)]\n#> [1] \"Liz Truss\"   \"Theresa May\"\n\nNext, let’s write down their birth year. The order is important! You need to keep the same order with PMs.\n\nbirth_years <- c(1980, # Rishi Sunak\n                 1975, # Liz Truss\n                 1964, # Boris Johnson\n                 1956, # Theresa May\n                 1966, # David Cameron\n                 1951, # Gordon Brown\n                 1953  # Tony Blair)\n                 )\n\nCheck the object we just created.\n\nbirth_years\n#> [1] 1980 1975 1964 1956 1966 1951 1953\n\nLet’s put them together in a spreadsheet. What we would like to do is to vertically bind the two objects, which is called column bind and denoted with cbind.\n\ncbind(names_pm, birth_years)\n#>      names_pm        birth_years\n#> [1,] \"Rishi Sunak\"   \"1980\"     \n#> [2,] \"Liz Truss\"     \"1975\"     \n#> [3,] \"Boris Johnson\" \"1964\"     \n#> [4,] \"Theresa May\"   \"1956\"     \n#> [5,] \"David Cameron\" \"1966\"     \n#> [6,] \"Gordon Brown\"  \"1951\"     \n#> [7,] \"Tony Blair\"    \"1953\"\n\nPut this into an object.\n\nmy_data <- cbind(names_pm, birth_years)\n\nmy_data\n#>      names_pm        birth_years\n#> [1,] \"Rishi Sunak\"   \"1980\"     \n#> [2,] \"Liz Truss\"     \"1975\"     \n#> [3,] \"Boris Johnson\" \"1964\"     \n#> [4,] \"Theresa May\"   \"1956\"     \n#> [5,] \"David Cameron\" \"1966\"     \n#> [6,] \"Gordon Brown\"  \"1951\"     \n#> [7,] \"Tony Blair\"    \"1953\"\n\nNote that birth_years are stored as text, not numbers. I know this because they are within quotation marks.\nIt is customary to keep spreadsheets as something called “data frames” in R. This will not change our data, but makes further operations easier by unlocking some of the features of R.\n\nmy_data <- as.data.frame(my_data)\n\nmy_data\n#>        names_pm birth_years\n#> 1   Rishi Sunak        1980\n#> 2     Liz Truss        1975\n#> 3 Boris Johnson        1964\n#> 4   Theresa May        1956\n#> 5 David Cameron        1966\n#> 6  Gordon Brown        1951\n#> 7    Tony Blair        1953\n\nWe can take a better look at the dataset using View() function.\n\n\nView(my_data)\n\nColumns in a data frame are also called variables. We have two variables in the dataset:\n\nnames_pm : Name of the UK PM\nbirth_years: Birth year of the PM\n\nThere are a few ways to access a variable. A straightforward approach is to use the $ notation:\n\n# 'name of the data frame'$'name of the variable' \nmy_data$names_pm\n#> [1] \"Rishi Sunak\"   \"Liz Truss\"     \"Boris Johnson\" \"Theresa May\"  \n#> [5] \"David Cameron\" \"Gordon Brown\"  \"Tony Blair\"\n\nNow it is your turn. Display the names variable.\n\n\nReveal the code\nmy_data$birth_years\n#> [1] \"1980\" \"1975\" \"1964\" \"1956\" \"1966\" \"1951\" \"1953\"\n\n\nYou can think this expression as a sentence in R. In plain English, this expression tells R to bring the variable names_pm within the data frame my_data. The symbol $ refers to the ‘within’ part of this sentence.\nJust like you can convey the same meaning using different sentence structures, there are different ways to do the same thing in R. This is because R is working exactly like a language: it is a language to communicate with the computer.\nAnother way is using the square brackets notation []. names_pm is the first column in the data frame. To get the variable, you could type the following.\n\nmy_data[,1]\n#> [1] \"Rishi Sunak\"   \"Liz Truss\"     \"Boris Johnson\" \"Theresa May\"  \n#> [5] \"David Cameron\" \"Gordon Brown\"  \"Tony Blair\"\n\nNote that we did not simply write my_data[1]. There is a comma: my_data[,1]\nIn a spreadsheet, we have two dimensions: rows and columns. By convention, rows are considered as the first dimension, and columns are considered as the second. This is why we had to use a comma to designate that we are interested in columns. If left the first dimension unspecified, which tells R to bring everything.\nIf you want to get the first row, you would type the following.\n\nmy_data[1,]\n#>      names_pm birth_years\n#> 1 Rishi Sunak        1980\n\nTry it yourself; get the fourth row.\n\n\nReveal the code\nmy_data[4,]\n#>      names_pm birth_years\n#> 4 Theresa May        1956\n\n\nLet’s put these together: you can tell R to bring a specific observation. For example, third row of second column.\n\nmy_data[3,2]\n#> [1] \"1964\"\n\nYou can also ask for multiple items by plugging in the combine function.\n\n# Third and fourth row of second column\nmy_data[c(3,4), 2]\n#> [1] \"1964\" \"1956\""

We can call these column vectors.\nTo get the first column, names_pm, we can use the square brackets notation.\n\n# Bring the first column\nmy_data[,1]\n#> [1] \"Rishi Sunak\"   \"Liz Truss\"     \"Boris Johnson\" \"Theresa May\"  \n#> [5] \"David Cameron\" \"Gordon Brown\"  \"Tony Blair\"\n\n# Bring the second column\nmy_data[,2]\n#> [1] \"1980\" \"1975\" \"1964\" \"1956\" \"1966\" \"1951\" \"1953\"\n\nWe left the first dimension, which designates the row, unspecified to tell R to bring everything. We could also use column names instead of column numbers.\n\n# Bring the column birth_years\nmy_data[,\"birth_years\"]\n#> [1] \"1980\" \"1975\" \"1964\" \"1956\" \"1966\" \"1951\" \"1953\"\n\n# Bring the column names_pm\nmy_data[,\"names_pm\"]\n#> [1] \"Rishi Sunak\"   \"Liz Truss\"     \"Boris Johnson\" \"Theresa May\"  \n#> [5] \"David Cameron\" \"Gordon Brown\"  \"Tony Blair\"\n\nWe can do the same for rows. To get a row vector, use the squared bracket notation.\n\n# Bring the first row\nmy_data[1, ]\n#>      names_pm   birth_years \n#> \"Rishi Sunak\"        \"1980\"\n\n# Bring the third row\nmy_data[3,]\n#>        names_pm     birth_years \n#> \"Boris Johnson\"          \"1964\"\n\n# Bring the fourth row\nmy_data[4,]\n#>      names_pm   birth_years \n#> \"Theresa May\"        \"1956\"\n\nR will give you an error message if you go out of bounds.\n\n# Bring the third column\nmy_data[,3]\n#> Error in my_data[, 3]: subscript out of bounds\n\n# Bring the 10th row\nmy_data[10,]\n#> Error in my_data[10, ]: subscript out of bounds\n\n# Bring the second column, ninth row\nmy_data[9,2]\n#> Error in my_data[9, 2]: subscript out of bounds"
